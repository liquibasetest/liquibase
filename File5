-- Example: Creating a view on top of a staging table with a subfolder path

-- Assuming you have a stage named "my_stage" already created pointing to a high-level directory

-- Create a view on top of the stage with the subfolder path
CREATE VIEW my_staging_view AS
SELECT *
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES(
  FILE_PATH=>'my_stage/subfolder/',
  PATTERN=>'*.csv', -- Adjust the pattern as per your file format
  FILE_FORMAT=>'CSV' -- Adjust the file format as per your files
));

-- Query the view to access the staged data
SELECT *
FROM my_staging_view;
