Hi Everyone,  

MSCI tables implemented successfully in the production environment and using the functional id, production support team able to successfully login and verify that table record displayed correctly

The following validation has been performed:

Table Count Comparison: Both MSCI table record counts for each partition in Snowflake are matching with Athena (without audit table), ensuring that Snowflake displays all records from the partition.

View Count Comparison: Snowflake views display the latest version for most partitions, and the counts match with Athena and Teradata.

Field Value Comparison Between Snowflake and Athena: For one MSCI table, comparison of varchar, date fields' minimum and maximum values, as well as numeric fields' minimum, maximum, and average values, are compared between Snowflake and Athena for selected partitions, all yielding matching results.

Record Sampling from Snowflake View: Selection of 10 records from the Snowflake view confirms that data is displayed in the expected format. Further Satyan will validate the datas with help of RDP analytics team.

Observations:

It was observed that data from 8 partitions (in the years 2019 and 2021) is not displayed in Snowflake views(in athena also without Audit table) due to incorrect entries in the audit table. However, these period values are present in Teradata.

Field value comparison between Athena and Teradata showed matching minimum and maximum values for numeric fields, but for some varchar fields, the maximum value differs between Snowflake and Teradata (with Snowflake matching Athena).

Currently, statistical analysis is being performed using different warehouse size roles (Small, Medium, Large), selecting specific partitions, and performing inner joins and self-joins on tables. The statistics will be provided by tomorrow.
