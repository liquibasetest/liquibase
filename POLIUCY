In a recent discussion with the Immuta team regarding masking policies, it was advised that default values for masking should be applied only to text (varchar) fields. For other data types, particularly numeric and date fields, they don't recommend setting default values due to potential complications. It's important for business users to be aware of the fields they have access to; querying fields they don't have access to, as is the case in Teradata, can result in errors.
