Access the JOB API through Lambda to interact with Immuta to implement fine-grained access control.

C2C FID should have access to the JOB entitlement, enabling the creation of datasources and the mapping of tags to datasources and columns.


Access the 5 batch account review tables in the JOB catalog and access datasource tags and column classifications present in the JOB catalog.

How to check the column classification.
How to check the table tags.
Register the data sources (external tables) in Immuta through the JOB API once the external table is created.

This needs to be done through Lambda.
This part should be done after creating the external table/view in Immuta.
API information is as follows:
Sample JSON to register.


Map the tags to the data sources (external tables) and the columns (data dictionary - Immuta).

This part should be done after creating the data sources in Immuta.
API information is as follows:
Sample JSON required.
Perform analysis on creating policies through the JOB API.

Verify the grant access through subscription policy in Immuta.

It's a POC to validate the performance and understand the subscription policy implementation.


As a user, I need to analyze how to create subscription and data policies in Immuta using the JOB API. This involves understanding policy requirements, designing policy structures, implementing policy creation through Lambda functions, and testing policy effectiveness. This analysis aims to streamline policy management within Immuta for improved data governance.
