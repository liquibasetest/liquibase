I have reviewed the Snowflake documentation regarding case sensitivity, particularly for JSON/CSV and Parquet files. In our current approach, we extract the $1 variant value from Parquet files and create tables from it. We use the GET keyword to retrieve values.

To address the case sensitivity issue, we can use the GET_IGNORE_CASE keyword. I have tested this with a mix of lower and upper case fields within the same file, and it works correctly. I will also test a scenario where some Parquet files contain lower case field names and others contain upper case field names to ensure it functions as expected.

Once confirmed, we can proceed without converting field names to upper or lower case.
